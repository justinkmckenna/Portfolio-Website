        <p>This website was built from scratch using HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h4>Battleship in C++</h4>
        <p>I recently built a battleship program in Visual Studio using my knowledge of Procedural <br> Programming. I've built two versions of this game, one using structures and one using <br> classes.</p>
    <h4>Thats it....for now</h4>
        <p>I am currently working on making this site more dynamic and am also learning Python. I <br> plan on getting building more programs in the near future.</p>
